archwizard needs a valid daimoninDir (the folder above arch folder)
config file currently supports:
path daimoninDir
editor externeditorpath

you can use config -> set path to set the path to daimoninDir, but this will overwrite the whole config and delete other definitions like editor
alternate you can load config, change the definitions in text editor and save this back

textfield:
can handle all menu commands, commands starts with @, without @ it goes to search mode
@number shows XObject at this index (more for debug)
show artifact by index use numbers greater than archetype.size
@+ and @- to browse XObject (more for debug)

search mode
you can search for equal or startwith using * as last char
* alone shows all objects

examples:
Object bread
Object bread*
artifact a*

showing all artifacts is currently "Object " with one whitespace (all artifacts should have empty Object definitions)
show all food you must search for type 6 and so on ...

@search
you can search for a selected text now, mark text, rightclick+search (only work with marked textarea in out tab)

@write (ctrl-w)
will write changes in table back to files
after write, see debug log for infos.
function is currently very brute logic, read/write same file again and again for each object change
ctrl+key also activated cell edit mode, so this is double functionality on ctrl-w
!carefully must be tested, don't try things like write null to end or object/artifact attributes, this will delete the lines and brake the logics

@save
you can save everytime the content of this textarea using @save, file @save or right click @save

@load
you can mark a path and choose load, if path is a valid file, filechooser picks this for default option (only work with marked textarea in out tab)

@extern
you can define an extern editor in archwizard, if path is correct you can start editor with @editor
you can mark a path and choose editor to open this file in extern editor (only work with marked textarea in out tab)
tested this with notepad++ on win 10

!If you made changes and used text save mechanics from outside or using intern textfile save function, currently memory data is not updated
You can do this manuell with reset function, i don't want to force a reset on each small textchange in raw data.

@export
export exports the data filtered by search command and filtered by attribute filter
so its same than the table, export writes data to your selected file in .csv format

@import
import tries to import from .csv format, it can only import, if it finds a unique key like Object or artifact and it can only import in existing objects.
after import see errors/warning or log it was successful, after that you also need a @write command and check if this was also successfull

errorlog/warning
if operations output errors/warning counter in statusfield, you can look in debug in this logs

@trim this
trims current textarea, after trimmed you need to save file
archetypes looks clean, it's only artifacts and perhaps in future unique errors in archetypes, so "trim this" is enough, currently no need for a "trim all" logic

TAB toogles through GUI - Object, in textarea it insert tabs
STRG-TAB toogles through GUI - Object
Cursor-Keys navigate textfield, textarea, list, tab, table

ESC Key, terminate process
F2 edit cell (in table edit)
@edit cells (input window) - ! this overwrites all selected rows, columns with the input from user, to delete attributes write "null"
Data->write - write all changes to files
Collect->Collect archetypes - ! build the archetypes in lib-folder
!it builds with an empty line between objects, so different from other collect logics, but works fine on server init.

STRG-A select all
STRG-C copy
STRG-V paste
STRG-X cut

STRG-< search
STRG-+ @+
STRG--  @-

STRG-S save
STRG-L load
STRG-E editor (extern) starting extern programm looses keyfocus

STRG-F Filter (toogles Filter view on/off)
Select all on filter is same result than select nothing, because nothing is a filter off toggle
filter is working realtime, rebuilding tableheaders and firetable to rebuild
select all strg-a
select none, select one, select this again with strg-key
select block with shift key
select multi with strg-key
rightclick menu on filter has 2 commands
lock (all selected attributes will be "locked", this means the filter list is sorted with only this attributes to make the list better readable)
unlock (is more a reset of this list and shows again all attributes)
!the search command automaticaly locks the attributes search found

STRG-ENTER keyfocus cmdfield
STRG-SPACE keyfocus cmdfield+clear this field
STRG-O keyfocus cmdfield + write Object+whitespace in cmdfield

other working combinations
in cmdfield, strg-a, str-x clean field (now you can use str-space)

protoarc is imported, currently not used

Backup (backup, restore, delete)
currently only working on .arc files in arch folder
